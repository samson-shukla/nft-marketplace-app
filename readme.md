## Creating an NFT MarketPlace with React Native ðŸ‘¾

Since a long time I wanted to create my own apps which can be uploaded to the Play and App Store for both Android and iOS devices.

Since Web3 and NFT is a hot topic right now, let's build an NFT MarketPlace using React Native.

> P.S. This project is more about creating UI of the app and not minting NFTs or implementing a backend.

The App consists of 2 screens.
1. Home Screen : Containing Header with App Logo, Profile Pic and Search functionality. Also some NFT item cards with necessary information like Name of the item, Name of the Artist, Price in Eth, etc is listed.
2. Details Screen : This screen contains the NFT, Time left for bidding, description of NFT, Current bids with Bidding info and Price.

The UI is fully responsive with phone gesture support, smooth navigation and clean-modern look.
