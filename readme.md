## Creating an NFT MarketPlace with React Native ðŸ‘¾

Since a long time I wanted to create my own apps which can be uploaded to the Play and App Store for both Android and iOS devices. Also wanted to work on Web3.
Here is a blend of both.

> In this repository I will be tracking everything I am learning in React Native and Web3.

First I will be foollowing a crash course on YouTube.
Then, will be modifying and playing to get familiar with this exciting tech.
Finally, will be creating something cool on my own.
